## Overview
This lab enhancement provides additional theoretical knowledge about Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It begins with simple illustrations and step-by-step guidance on how PCA is performed using sample data. While explaining the foundations of PCA, key concepts such as the differences between Eigenvalues and Singular Values are clarified. Additionally, a real-world dataset from Kaggle was utilized to apply PCA in practice. The dataset focuses on predicting individuals' obesity levels based on factors such as gender, age, height, weight, eating behaviors, and more. Before modeling, data preprocessing was conducted to ensure data quality. Logistic Regression was chosen as the classification model, and its performance was compared with and without PCA. Moreover, this lab enhancement includes additional visualization functions, such as visualizing the most important features for a given principal component. Finally, key considerations regarding PCA were addressed, including the types of datasets where PCA is most applicable.
