## Overview
This lab enhancement exercise focuses on improving K-means clustering by combining principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality. A student achievement dataset is used. The goal is to optimize clustering performance by reducing feature redundancy while maintaining a meaningful data structure. Elbow method and silhouette scores are used to determine the optimal number of clusters (K=3). In addition, K-means clustering is compared with hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN to evaluate the clustering results.
