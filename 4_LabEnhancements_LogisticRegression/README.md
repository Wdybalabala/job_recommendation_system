Modified original lab for clarification on logistic regression, rearranging and rewording to clarify and explain concepts better

In "Improve the Model" subsection within "Single-Predictor Binary Logistic Regression" section, added cross-validation methods to expound upon the hyperparameter tuning of regularization (C value) in logistic regression, demonstrating and visualizing the differences of different hyperparameters. This method can be applied to other types of logistic regression as well.
