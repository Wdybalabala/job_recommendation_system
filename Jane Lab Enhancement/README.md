# LabEnhancement_Linear Regression

## Overview
This is a lab enhancement exercise focused on predicting house prices using three types of linear regression models: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Polynomial Regression. The goal is to evaluate how these three(3) models perform when trained on datasets with different numbers of features (2 features, 5 features, and all features). Additionally, for simple linear regression, the impact of log transformation on model performance is investigated by comparing results before and after applying the transformation. The performance of each model is assessed using two key metrics which are Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

### Objectives:
- Simple Linear Regression: 
    - Test the model using 1 feature to predict the target variable.
    - Investigate the effect of log transformation on the features by comparing performance before and after transformation.

- Multiple Linear Regression: 
    - Evaluate the model's performance using 2, 5, and all features.

- Polynomial Regression: 
    - Investigate the model's ability to capture nonlinear relationships by testing it with 1, 5, all, and selected features.
